## Prerequisite
Must have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed to build the application. Refer to the link for installation instructions.

*Note: Users donot have to install anything*

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```
It should install [express^4](http://expressjs.com/), [socket.io](https://socket.io) and [svelte](https://svelte.dev)
...then start:

```bash
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
