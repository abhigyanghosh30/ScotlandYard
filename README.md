## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```
It should install [express^4](http://expressjs.com/), [socket.io](https://socket.io) and [svelte](https://svelte.dev)
...then start:

```bash
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.


You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
